            <h1>My Current Homelab <small>(Jan. 1st 2026)</small></h1>

            <p>
                As this website is dedicated to my homelab and documenting that, I should probably go through what is in my current homelab. It's not very much but it does the job for me. As of writing, this is all accurate, though I suspect it will change over the year.
                I do want to get some rack mounted equipment at some point, but we'll see how that goes. I also want to do some Raspberry Pi or <x title="Single Board Computer">SBC</x> stuff in terms of homelabbing, or even some Mini PC stuff. Who knows?
            </p>

            <p>
                My main PC specs make no sense, and isn't <i>technically</i> part of the homelab but I'm putting it here beacuse I want to show off the fact I have RAM in 2026, and for some reason run 2 GPUs.

            <h2 id="z230">The Server</h2>
            <p>
                This "server" is actually just an HP Z230 Tower Workstation that I originally bought because I wanted to use it as a case, then I bought a CPU for it, used it as a Windows XP machine for a little bit, then turned it into the server.
                At some point I want to get an <x title="Host Bus Adaptor">HBA</x> and use a <x title="Just-a-Bunch-Of-Disks">JBOD</x> for more storage, as the Z230 board only has 5 SATA ports, and I've used them all.
            </p>

            <h2 id="networking">Networking Equipment</h2>
            <p>
                My networking equipment is very basic. It just extends the Wi-Fi from downstairs to the room. That's pretty much all. I do have plans for networking though.
